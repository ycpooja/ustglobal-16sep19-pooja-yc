    <p>3D computer graphics or three-dimensional computer graphics, are graphics that use a three-dimensional representation of geometric data that is stored in the computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering 2D images. such images may be stored for viewing later or displayed in real-time. 3D computer graphics are often referred to as 3D models. A model can be displayed visually as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering or used in non-graphical computer simulations and calculations. A 3D model can be described as a model which portrays an object in a 3D graphical mode and the process of developing 3D models is what is known as 3D modeling. Used in industries like 3D printing, interior design, architecture, film, gaming, and animation.
